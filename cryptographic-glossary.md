# Cryptographic Glossary

## RSA key pair
An RSA key is a cryptographic key used in the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption algorithm, which is widely used for secure data transmission. RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, meaning it uses two different keys: a public key and a private key.

- **Public Key**: This key is shared with everyone. It is used to encrypt data or verify a digital signature. Because the key is public, anyone can use it to send encrypted data to the owner of the corresponding private key.

- **Private Key**: This key is kept secret by the owner. It is used to decrypt data that was encrypted with the public key or to create a digital signature. Only the owner of the private key can decrypt data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key.

**Key Features of RSA:**

1. **Asymmetry**: RSA relies on the mathematical relationship between the public and private keys. The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, which makes it computationally challenging to derive the private key from the public key.

2. **Key Length**: RSA keys are typically much longer than keys used in symmetric encryption algorithms. Common lengths for RSA keys are 2048 bits or 4096 bits, which provide strong security but require more computational power.

3. **Encryption and Decryption**: In RSA, a message encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, and vice versa. This property is useful for secure communications, digital signatures, and authentication.

4. **Digital Signatures**: RSA can be used to create digital signatures, which authenticate the origin and integrity of a message. The sender signs a message with their private key, and the recipient can verify the signature using the sender's public key.

**Applications**: RSA is used in various security protocols, including Snowflake Authentication for service accounts, SSL/TLS (for secure web browsing), PGP (for secure email), and in some VPNs and other encrypted communication methods.
