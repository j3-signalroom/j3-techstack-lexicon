# GitHub Glossary

## Fork
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository.  Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.

## Repository (a.k.a., Repo)
A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history.
