# Data Mesh Glossary

## Domain Data Archetypes
There are three archetypes of domain-oriented data:

1. **Source-Aligned Domain Data**
    - **Definition**: This is analytical data that closely reflects the raw business facts generated by operational systems. It represents data in its original, "native" form, with minimal transformation applied to it.
    - **Other Name**: **Native Data Product**.
    - **Characteristics**:
        - Represents transactional data or events directly from source systems.
        - Usually adheres to the structure of the underlying operational systems.
        - Provides transparency and full fidelity of the original data, making it suitable for use cases where end users need raw, detailed information for further analysis or aggregation.
        - Examples: Customer orders, product inventories, sales transactions.
    - **Use Cases**:
        - Basis for creating further derived data products.
        - Enables detailed analysis by domain experts.
        - Useful for operational reporting and debugging data discrepancies.

2. **Aggregate Domain Data**
    - **Definition**: Analytical data that is an aggregation of multiple upstream domains, often combined into a unified view to reflect the business across multiple related domains.
    - **Characteristics**:
        - Derived by integrating data from multiple source-aligned domains.
        - Typically involves aggregation, summarization, and calculations (e.g., metrics, KPIs).
        - Represents a more abstract level of data, providing a higher-level overview.
        - Examples: Sales performance summaries across regions, customer lifetime value aggregated from various touchpoints.
    - **Use Cases**:
        - Common for generating metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and dashboards.
        - Facilitates cross-functional analysis by combining data across domains.
        - Used by business analysts for insights into trends, patterns, and high-level business health indicators.

3. **Consumer-Aligned Domain Data**
    - **Definition**: Analytical data that is transformed to fit the needs of one or multiple specific use cases. It is customized to serve the requirements of specific data consumers.
    - **Other Name**: **Fit-for-Purpose Domain Data**.
    - **Characteristics**:
        - Built with a particular use case in mind, often aligning with consumer-specific requirements like simplified data formats, denormalized structures, or enriched datasets.
        - It is highly optimized for a specific application, such as a dashboard, a machine learning model, or business intelligence tool.
        - Examples: Predictive analytics data prepared for a machine learning pipeline, customer profiles enriched with behavior scores.
    - **Use Cases**:
        - Used by end users like business analysts, data scientists, and downstream applications for specific insights or decision-making.
        - Enables efficient and fast access to data tailored to particular queries or applications, reducing the transformation work required by end users.
        - Useful for driving personalization in consumer applications, powering recommendation engines, or providing the data needed for regulatory reporting.

**Summary of Domain Data Archetypes**
- **Source-Aligned Domain Data**: Represents raw, native data reflecting operational business facts; detailed and unprocessed.
- **Aggregate Domain Data**: Combines and summarizes data from multiple domains to provide an integrated, aggregated view for analysis.
- **Consumer-Aligned Domain Data**: Tailored to meet the needs of specific consumer use cases; typically transformed for ease of use and purpose-fit consumption.

In a **data mesh** architecture, these archetypes correspond to different stages of data evolution:
- **Source-Aligned Domain Data** acts as a foundational "data as a product," where domain teams own and manage raw data products.
- **Aggregate Domain Data** is produced by integrating across multiple source-aligned domains, often under shared governance and through collaborations between teams.
- **Consumer-Aligned Domain Data** is highly contextual, providing the exact shape of the data that meets a consumer's requirements, often built by specific consumer or use case-oriented teams.

## Polysemes
**Polysemes** represent core business concepts that exist across multiple domains, but with distinct attributes, behaviors, and interpretations depending on the domain's context. For example, the concept of a "customer" is a polyseme because:

- In the **sales domain**, a customer might include attributes like *purchase history* and *preferred products*.
- In the **support domain**, a customer might focus on *open tickets* and *support history*.
  
These variations are influenced by each domain's **bounded context**, a key principle in DDD (Domain Driven Design) that delineates how a concept is modeled and used within a specific domain.

### **Polysemes and Data Mesh**

A **data mesh** enables domains to own their analytical data as products while maintaining autonomy. When combined with polysemes, this approach provides a mechanism to model shared business concepts with domain-specific adaptations. Here's how:

1. **Bounded Contexts in Domains**:
   - Each domain models a polyseme independently, capturing attributes and behaviors relevant to its needs.
   - For example, the **sales domain** might model a "customer" polyseme with attributes like *lifetime value* and *conversion rate*, while the **support domain** focuses on *ticket response time* and *satisfaction score*.

2. **Cross-Domain Mapping**:
   - Despite their contextual differences, polysemes are linked through a **global identifier** (e.g., a customer ID). This enables a unified view across domains for cross-domain analysis.
   - Example: Analysts could join data from sales and support domains to understand how customer support interactions influence purchasing behavior.

3. **Preserving Autonomy with Interoperability**:
   - Domains remain autonomous, modeling their polysemes according to their bounded context.
   - However, **data product contracts** define how the shared attributes (e.g., global identifiers) are exposed, ensuring interoperability while maintaining domain independence.

### **Benefits of Polysemes in a Data Mesh**
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Domains can model polysemes with attributes and behaviors specific to their needs without disrupting other domains.
- **Shared Understanding**: Polysemes ensure that all domains share a common core concept, promoting consistency in business terminology.
- **Scalable Analysis**: With global identifiers, businesses can perform cross-domain analysis, providing insights that span multiple facets of the organization.
- **Flexibility and Evolution**: As domains evolve, their representations of polysemes can change independently without breaking global mappings.

By leveraging polysemes in a data mesh architecture, organizations can balance the need for domain autonomy with the ability to unify and analyze shared business concepts across the enterprise. This approach fosters collaboration, reduces data silos, and enables deeper insights while respecting the nuances of each domain.
